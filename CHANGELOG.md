## Changelog for version 3.1.2

### Fixed

- Updated the add-on to be fully compatible with patch 8.2.5, including fixing a change causing dialogs with multiple quests available to have the wrong text for the quest titles or to cause Lua errors.

### Added

- Added popup tutorial frames that will appear once to explain to new users some of the hard to discover behavior of Storyline. For now this includes scrolling on the list of dialog options when there are more available, and clicking on a reward to choose it.

## Changelog for version 3.1.1

### Fixed

- Fixed a display issue with the new dynamic backgrounds for campaign quests. Only the campaign specific background will now be shown, and the background has proper borders fading.

## Changelog for version 3.1.0

### Added

- Storyline will now display backgrounds specific for the zone you are currently in (from the pool of follower missions backgrounds). 
- I was finally able to add the parchment object to the reading animation on the player model. Special thanks to Peterodox, developer of the [Narcissus add-on](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/narcissus) for his help on this.
