# Changelog

## 3.0 - Unreleased

### Modified

- Completely re-implemented the way animations are played on the 3D models. Using new in-game methods for timing animations, we no longer need our own database of animation timings. All models are now timed automatically by the game. **(Note: In this first alpha, some dialogs are not animated, this will be fixed in a future build.)**

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue that prevented dead NPCs to appear as dead in Storyline.

### Fixed

- Fixed an error when displaying the tooltip for currency quest objectives (order hall resources, nethershards, etc.).

### Fixed

- You can now right-click the objectives and rewards popup frames to close them.
